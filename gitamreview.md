##### STUDENT REVIEW 
###### 3rd Year
I am _Syed Abbas Aman_, studying in **_GITAM_**, Bangalore Campus. **_GITAM_** is deemed to be a university located in Nagdenhalli, Karnataka. The GITAM University is headed by its main branch located in Vishakapatnam. This offers UG and PG courses. It has a pleasant environment on the campus and it allows the students to have a peaceful study time. The courses and the training structures offered at _GITAM_ are well planned and are most worthy to get a job and gain better knowledge. Along with the hostel facilities offered GITAM is probably one of the best choices to have a good college life and studies.

_Gitam_ is _one of the best colleges_ in **_south India_**. Gitam has the _NAC acribit of A+_. Gitam has branches in _Andhra, Karnataka and Telangana_. The branch in _Vizag_ is the _best of the three campuses_ to pursue your degree. Gitam has been producing great successful graduates. Gitam develops the student based on _continuous evaluation_. The student evaluation method is also so creative based on continuous progress which helps the students analyse and develop themselves. The _job opportunities are also greatly increasing_ every year. Any person wanting useful graduation and job must take Gitam at the top of the list.
